### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Sangeon Ahn, a database systems engineer focused on building highly scalable and efficient relational database management systems (RDBMS). My core areas include:
- Distributed transaction processing and concurrency control algorithms
- Database performance tuning

I have a deep passion for database internals and systems engineering. My work involves developing core components of RDBMS, leveraging my strong expertise in computer science fundamentals, low-level systems programming, and database internals.

I'm also interested in exploring storage engines like LSM trees and WiredTiger, as well as in-memory database technologies.
